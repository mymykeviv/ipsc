### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Development environment
python3 deployment/deploy.py dev

# UAT environment
python3 deployment/deploy.py uat --test

# Production environment
python3 deployment/deploy.py prod --clean

# Manual cache cleaning
bash deployment/scripts/clean-cache.sh [environment]
```

## 🧹 Cache Cleaning Features

### Automatic Cache Cleaning
- **Frontend caches**: JS files, source maps, build directories
- **Backend caches**: Python cache files, test cache, virtual environment
- **Docker caches**: Containers, images, volumes, networks
- **Kubernetes caches**: kubectl cache, local k8s cache files
- **System caches**: npm cache, pip cache, git cache

### Environment-Specific Cleaning
- **Development**: Light cleaning, preserves node_modules
- **UAT**: Moderate cleaning, removes build artifacts
- **Production**: Full cleaning, removes all caches and dependencies

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **13 test cases** covering all aspects of the new system
- **100% success rate** in validation tests
- **File existence checks** for all new components
- **Script validation** for functionality and permissions
- **Configuration validation** for Docker Compose and Kubernetes
- **Documentation validation** for completeness and accuracy

### Test Results
```
Total Tests: 13
Passed: 13
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100.0%
