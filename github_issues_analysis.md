## User Story Analysis

### **User Story #1: Low Stock Alerts**

#### **Clarification Questions**

| Thought | Question | Suggested Answer |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Need to understand what triggers the alert | What should be the minimum stock level for each product? | Allow users to set custom minimum levels per product, with a default of 10 units |
| Need to clarify notification method | How should the system notify users about low stock? | Email notifications for business owners, in-app notifications for warehouse managers, with option to configure frequency |
| Need to understand alert timing | When should the alert be triggered - exactly at minimum level or before? | Alert when stock reaches minimum level, with an optional "warning" at 150% of minimum level |
| Need to clarify product scope | Should alerts apply to all products or only active ones? | Only active products should trigger alerts, with option to include discontinued products |
| Need to understand alert grouping | Should multiple low stock items be grouped in one notification? | Group alerts by severity (critical: below minimum, warning: approaching minimum) and allow daily digest option |

#### **Final User Story**

**User Story: Low Stock Alert System**
- **Description:** As a business owner, I want to receive notifications when product stock falls below minimum levels so that I can reorder before running out of inventory.
- **Core Domain Objects:** Product, StockLevel, Alert, Notification
- **Attributes and Rules:** 
  - Minimum stock levels must be configurable per product
  - Alerts must be sent within 1 hour of stock reaching minimum level
  - System must support email and in-app notifications
  - Only active products should trigger alerts

#### **Given/When/Then Scenarios**

**Happy Path:**
- **Given** a product has minimum stock level set to 10 units
- **When** the stock level drops to 9 units
- **Then** a low stock alert should be sent to the business owner

**Warning Path:**
- **Given** a product has minimum stock level set to 10 units
- **When** the stock level drops to 15 units
- **Then** a warning notification should be sent (if enabled)

**Multiple Products:**
- **Given** multiple products are below their minimum stock levels
- **When** the daily digest is enabled
- **Then** all low stock items should be grouped in a single email

**Exception Paths:**
- **Given** a product is marked as discontinued
- **When** its stock level drops below minimum
- **Then** no alert should be sent

- **Given** the email service is unavailable
- **When** a low stock condition occurs
- **Then** the alert should be queued and retried, with in-app notification as fallback

#### **INVEST Critique**
- **Independent:** âœ… Can be implemented without dependencies on other features
- **Negotiable:** âœ… Details can be refined during development
- **Valuable:** âœ… Provides clear business value
- **Estimable:** âœ… Scope is well-defined and measurable
- **Small:** âœ… Can be completed in 1-2 sprints
- **Testable:** âœ… Clear acceptance criteria and scenarios
