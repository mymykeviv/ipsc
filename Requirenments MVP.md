## Questions for Clarification
1. Preferred Tech Stack:
Do you have a preferred language/framework (e.g., Python/Django, Node/Express, Electron, desktop app, etc.)? No, any is fine. Consider robustness and data integrity as major factors.
Should the UI be web-based, desktop GUI, or CLI? UI should be web based.

2. Data Storage:

Is a local file-based DB (SQLite, JSON, etc.) acceptable, or do you require a specific DB?
Should data be portable (easy backup/restore)? for transactional data maintain relational databases with ACID complaince, for reporting and auditing use can use nosql db like elasticsearch etc
Email Integration: Yes, should be able to send invoices and reports over email if required, should be able to integreate existing email services like gmail and or outlook.com. 

Should the app use local SMTP settings for sending emails, or is manual export sufficient for MVP? BOTH are needed
GST Logic: follow Indian GST law for this

Do you have specific GST rules/tax slabs, or should we use standard Indian GST rates? Standard Indian GST rates
Any sample invoice/report formats to follow? Use Indian GST invoice format for MVP and same for reporting
User Authentication: basic local account management with RBAC

Is simple local authentication (username/password) sufficient for now?yes, with role based access
Platform: any

Should the app run on Windows/Mac/Linux, or only Mac (your current platform)? platform agnostic, thought it should be able to run on container like docker or kubernetes for scalibility
