## [1.4.8] - 2025-08-25

### Added
- Inventory: Enriched stock movement history API and UI to align with stock register requirements
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`): `StockTransactionOut` now includes add-only optional fields `sku`, `category`, `supplier_name`.
  - Backend: When `ref_type == 'purchase'`, join `Purchase` → `Party` to populate `supplier_name` and `reference_number`.
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/components/StockMovementHistoryTable.tsx`): Added columns and CSV fields for `SKU`, `Category`, `Supplier`, and `Balance`.
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/components/StockHistoryForm.tsx`): Mapped API fields into table rows including `sku`, `category`, `supplier`, and `running_balance`.

### Fixed
- Inventory: Closing stock and totals calculation previously corrected remain intact
  - Running balance uniformly adds signed quantities for `in`, `out`, and `adjust`.
  - Totals aggregate magnitudes appropriately (incoming = positives, outgoing = abs(negatives)).

### Compatibility
- API changes are strictly additive (optional fields). No breaking changes. Existing consumers remain compatible.

### Tests
- Backend: Added/validated scenarios for mixed sequences and verified closing stock equals opening + signed net movement; verified presence of enriched fields where applicable.
- Frontend: Verified table renders new columns and CSV export includes the new fields.

### Notes
- Performance: Supplier lookup occurs only for `purchase`-linked rows. Can be optimized later via prefetch/caching if needed.

## [1.4.7] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Authorization: Made role checks case-insensitive in `backend/app/auth.py` to prevent 403 errors when DB role casing differs (e.g., `admin` vs `Admin`).
  - Affected endpoints: any protected by `require_role(...)` or `require_any_role(["Admin","Store"])` such as `POST /api/products`.
  - Verified via curl and UI: Admin token can now create products and other protected resources.

### Operations
- Dev Docker stack validation: Confirmed services healthy via `deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` and performed successful product creation against backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Notes
- No database schema changes. Behavior-only change in authorization comparison logic.

## [1.4.6] - 2025-08-25

### Changed
- Adopted a single baseline Alembic migration strategy and ensured all environments run `alembic upgrade head` before backend startup.
- Updated Docker Compose files to prepend Alembic migrations to backend start commands:
  - `deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`
  - `deployment/docker/docker-compose.uat.yml`
  - `deployment/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`
  - `deployment/standalone/docker-compose.yml`
  - Root `docker-compose.yml`
- Updated CI pipeline `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run migrations against the test DB before backend tests and before spinning up the e2e backend server.
- Updated artifact generation to embed migration step:
  - `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml`
  - `scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh`
- Updated local development scripts to run migrations before uvicorn:
  - `scripts/local-dev.sh`
  - `scripts/local-dev-clean.sh`

### Notes
- Seeding is dev-only. UAT/Prod deployments must not seed data automatically.
