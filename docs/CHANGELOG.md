## [1.50.4] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- PDF preview template selection resetting on refresh
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/components/PDFViewer.tsx`): Decoupled template loading from template selection changes. Load templates only when modal opens; reload PDF via a dedicated effect on `selectedTemplateId`. Prevents the dropdown from reverting to default when the iframe refreshes.
- Corrupted PDF downloads when backend returned HTML error pages
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`): `apiGetInvoicePDF()` now sets `Accept: application/pdf` and validates `Content-Type`. Throws descriptive errors for non-PDF responses to avoid saving corrupted files.

### Added
- Distinct invoice PDF layouts and visible footer markers for template verification
  - Backend (`backend/app/pdf_generator.py`):
    - Added visible footer marker showing `template_id` and `paper_size` in generated PDFs.
    - Implemented list-style layouts for `GST_SIMPLE` and `NONGST_SIMPLE` templates; `NONGST_TABULAR` now uses columns without GST fields.

### Operations
- PDF engine enablement in backend image
  - Backend (`backend/Dockerfile`): Installed WeasyPrint system dependencies (cairo, pango, gdk-pixbuf, fonts, etc.) and ensured Python packages via `requirements_pdf.txt`.
  - Rebuild and recreate backend container required for changes to take effect.

---
## [1.50.3] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- PDF supplier header formatting
  - Backend (`backend/app/pdf_css.py`): Unified contact color with address text for consistent header styling.
  - Backend (`backend/app/pdf_generator.py`): Render supplier City, State, and Pincode on a single line (e.g., `Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226001`).
- Company Settings upsert persistence
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`): `PUT /api/company/settings` now includes `address_line1/2`, `city`, `pincode`, `phone`, `email` during initial create as well as on update.

### Added
- Invoices list totals meta (INR-only)
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`): `GET /api/invoices` now attaches `meta.totals` with INR-only aggregates (count, subtotal, discount, tax, total, amount_paid, outstanding) when available.

### Notes
- No DB schema changes. Additive and styling-only updates; API response shape gains optional `meta` field.

---
## [1.50.2] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- Deployment package start script: avoid "unbound variable" for `VERSION` by emitting a safe default when the env var is absent. Implemented in `scripts/release-packager.sh` so generated `start.sh` is robust.

### Changed
- Release packager now generates backend `DATABASE_URL` in docker-compose with psycopg v3 driver: `postgresql+psycopg://...` (instead of `postgresql://...`). Aligns with `backend/requirements.txt` (`psycopg[binary]`) and `Settings.database_url`, preventing Alembic from attempting to import `psycopg2`.

### Ops Notes
- For existing deployment packages, manually update the backend service `DATABASE_URL` to `postgresql+psycopg://...` and restart the backend. This resolves startup migration failures and eliminates 502s at `/api/auth/login`.

---
## [1.50.1] - 2025-08-26

### Added
- Scripts: Introduced unified `scripts/seed.sh` for dev/test seeding with venv and DB readiness checks.
- Scripts: Added `scripts/stop-stack.sh` to stop `dev|uat|prod` stacks; runs backup automatically for `prod`.

### Changed
- Scripts: `scripts/dev-up.sh` now supports `--setup` to run preflight via `scripts/setup-docker-env.sh` (if present) and pull images before bringing up the dev stack. Preserves `SKIP_TESTS`.
- Scripts: `scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh` supports `--preflight` (checks only) and `--quick` (single-arch, skip packaging) flags. Default remains multi-arch build with deployment packages.
- Scripts: `scripts/clean.sh` now accepts `--stack dev|uat|prod` and uses Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`). `--deep` preserved.
- Standardized all scripts to Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`).

### Deprecated
- `scripts/dev-setup.sh` → use `./scripts/dev-up.sh --setup`.
- `scripts/quick-docker-build.sh` → use `./scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh --quick`.
- `scripts/stop-docker-dev.sh`, `scripts/stop-docker-prod.sh` → use `./scripts/stop-stack.sh dev|prod`.
- `scripts/run-ui-ux-tests.sh` → use `./scripts/test-runner.sh`.
- `scripts/local-dev.sh`, `scripts/local-dev-clean.sh`, `scripts/restart-local-dev.sh` → use `./scripts/start-local.sh` and `./scripts/clean.sh`.

### Notes
- No backend/frontend code changes in this patch; operations and documentation only.
- README updated with a new "Scripts (streamlined)" section and usage examples.

---
## [1.50.0-stable] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Cashflow Transactions API type error during sorting
  - Backend (`backend/app/profitpath_service.py`): Standardized `transaction_date` to `DateTime` by casting `Payment.payment_date` to `DateTime` in `get_cashflow_transactions()`. Prevents `datetime` vs `date` comparison errors during sort.
- Reports: incorrect amount field for invoice payments
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`): Replaced uses of non-existent `payment_payment`/`payment_amount` on `Payment` with correct `Payment.amount` in:
    - Cashflow report income transactions
    - Payment report invoice transactions and monthly trend
    - Income report payment aggregation per invoice
  - Result: Correct totals and no attribute errors across Cashflow, Payments, and Income reports.

### Changed
- UI: Sidebar label corrected
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/modules/App.tsx`): Renamed "ProfitPath Analytics" to "Cashflow Analytics" under Reporting & Analytics.

### Notes
- No DB schema changes. Behavior-only fixes and label update.
- Compatibility: Changes are backward compatible; response shapes unchanged, only amount sourcing fixed.

---
## [1.4.12] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Invoice Payments 404 on list screen and unstyled view dialog
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`):
    - Added `GET /api/invoices/payments` endpoint to return all invoice payments with fields expected by the UI (`payment_amount`, `payment_method`, etc.).
    - Added backward-compatible alias `GET /api/invoice-payments`.
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/Payments.tsx`):
    - Replaced unstyled `alert()` with a proper `<Modal>` for viewing payment details.
    - Fixed JSX structure by wrapping table + modal in a fragment to resolve a Babel parse error.
    - Standardized `createApiErrorHandler` usage via `useMemo`.

### Verification
- Navigating to `/payments/invoice/list` now loads without 404; payments fetch from `/api/invoices/payments` (or alias) succeeds.
- Clicking "View" opens a styled modal with payment details.

### Compatibility
- Additive endpoints; existing flows remain intact.

---
## [1.4.11] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Invoice Payments: Pending amount always 0 and inability to add payments
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`):
    - Added missing `POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/payments` endpoint, updating `paid_amount`, `balance_amount`, and `status`.
    - In invoices list API (`GET /api/invoices`), response model now includes `paid_amount` and `balance_amount`.
    - Removed duplicate `PaymentIn` class that conflicted with expected payload fields and caused HTTP 422.
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/components/PaymentForm.tsx`):
    - Added fallback computation for pending amount as `grand_total - paid_amount` if `balance_amount` is missing.
  - Result: Payment form shows correct pending amount and can submit payments successfully.

### Tests
- Backend: Added `tests/backend/invoice_payments_spec.py` covering list fields and payment posting updates.

### Compatibility
- API changes are additive to the invoices list response; existing consumers remain compatible. Payment endpoint now available under `/api` router.

---
## [1.4.10] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Purchase Payments: Date range filter now includes the entire end date
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/PurchasePayments.tsx`): End boundary set to `23:59:59.999` to avoid excluding payments made on the selected end day.
  - Result: Payments returned by API for the selected period now render correctly; empty-state no longer appears erroneously.

### Compatibility
- UI-only behavior change; no API or schema changes. Fully backward compatible.

### Verification
- With default last-30-days filter, payments dated on the end day are visible.
- Quick actions tested: Current FY, Cash Payment.
- Edge case validated: start date == end date shows payments for that day.

---
## [1.4.9] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Company Settings persistence and related invoice/purchase errors
  - Backend: Implemented upsert for `PUT /api/company/settings` so the first save creates a record if missing.
    - Updated `backend/app/routers.py` and `backend/app/main_routers.py` to create `CompanySettings` with sensible defaults and then apply updates.
  - Frontend: Wired `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` to call backend APIs
    - On load: `GET /api/company/settings` populates form (ignores 404 if not yet configured)
    - On save: `PUT /api/company/settings` sends mapped fields with Authorization header
  - Result: Saving Company Details now persists correctly; invoice/purchase flows no longer fail due to missing company settings.

### Changed
- Company Settings UI now reflects only backend-supported fields
  - Removed UI-only fields from the Company Details form (email, phone, website, address, PAN, logo URL) to avoid mismatch with backend schema.
  - Added inputs for `state`, `state_code`, and GST flags; ensured `invoice_series` maps to invoice prefix.

### Compatibility
- API changes are backward compatible (same endpoints). Frontend form fields now align with backend schema.

### Verification
- First-time save creates a `CompanySettings` row and returns 200.
- Subsequent GET returns populated fields: `name`, `gstin`, `state`, `state_code`, `invoice_series`, `gst_enabled_by_default`, `require_gstin_validation`.

---
## [1.4.8] - 2025-08-25

### Added
- Inventory: Enriched stock movement history API and UI to align with stock register requirements
  - Backend (`backend/app/main_routers.py`): `StockTransactionOut` now includes add-only optional fields `sku`, `category`, `supplier_name`.
  - Backend: When `ref_type == 'purchase'`, join `Purchase` → `Party` to populate `supplier_name` and `reference_number`.
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/components/StockMovementHistoryTable.tsx`): Added columns and CSV fields for `SKU`, `Category`, `Supplier`, and `Balance`.
  - Frontend (`frontend/src/components/StockHistoryForm.tsx`): Mapped API fields into table rows including `sku`, `category`, `supplier`, and `running_balance`.

### Fixed
- Inventory: Closing stock and totals calculation previously corrected remain intact
  - Running balance uniformly adds signed quantities for `in`, `out`, and `adjust`.
  - Totals aggregate magnitudes appropriately (incoming = positives, outgoing = abs(negatives)).

### Compatibility
- API changes are strictly additive (optional fields). No breaking changes. Existing consumers remain compatible.

### Tests
- Backend: Added/validated scenarios for mixed sequences and verified closing stock equals opening + signed net movement; verified presence of enriched fields where applicable.
- Frontend: Verified table renders new columns and CSV export includes the new fields.

### Notes
- Performance: Supplier lookup occurs only for `purchase`-linked rows. Can be optimized later via prefetch/caching if needed.

---

## [1.4.7] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- Authorization: Made role checks case-insensitive in `backend/app/auth.py` to prevent 403 errors when DB role casing differs (e.g., `admin` vs `Admin`).
  - Affected endpoints: any protected by `require_role(...)` or `require_any_role(["Admin","Store"])` such as `POST /api/products`.
  - Verified via curl and UI: Admin token can now create products and other protected resources.

### Operations
- Dev Docker stack validation: Confirmed services healthy via `deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` and performed successful product creation against backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Notes
- No database schema changes. Behavior-only change in authorization comparison logic.

---

## [1.4.6] - 2025-08-25

### Changed
- Adopted a single baseline Alembic migration strategy and ensured all environments run `alembic upgrade head` before backend startup.
- Updated Docker Compose files to prepend Alembic migrations to backend start commands:
  - `deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`
  - `deployment/docker/docker-compose.uat.yml`
  - `deployment/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`
  - `deployment/standalone/docker-compose.yml`
  - Root `docker-compose.yml`
- Updated CI pipeline `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run migrations against the test DB before backend tests and before spinning up the e2e backend server.
- Updated artifact generation to embed migration step:
  - `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml`
  - `scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh`
- Updated local development scripts to run migrations before uvicorn:
  - `scripts/local-dev.sh`
  - `scripts/local-dev-clean.sh`

### Notes
- Seeding is dev-only. UAT/Prod deployments must not seed data automatically.
