## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Purchase Payment Save Failure
**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** High - Core functionality broken

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Frontend `PurchasePayments.tsx` uses mock data instead of actual API calls
- Missing proper error handling for payment creation
- Backend API endpoints exist but frontend integration incomplete

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Current implementation in PurchasePayments.tsx (lines 50-70)
// Mock payment data - replace with actual API call
purchases.forEach(purchase => {
  if (purchase.grand_total > 0) {
    payments.push({
      id: purchase.id,
      purchase_id: purchase.id,
      // ... mock data
    })
  }
})
```

**Required Fixes:**
1. Implement proper API integration for purchase payments
2. Add error handling for payment save operations
3. Create comprehensive tests for payment workflows

### 2. Invoice Payment Links Broken
**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** High - Payment functionality inaccessible

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Navigation links in invoice list point to incorrect routes
- Missing payment form integration
- Inconsistent routing between invoice and payment modules

**Technical Details:**
- Invoice list shows "Add Payment" buttons but links are broken
- Payment forms not properly integrated with invoice context
- Missing proper state management for payment workflows

### 3. Invoice List Broken
**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** High - Core business functionality affected

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Multiple backup files indicate previous issues
- Potential data loading problems
- UI rendering issues

**Technical Details:**
- Files: `Invoices.tsx.backup`, `Invoices.tsx.backup2`, `Invoices.tsx.broken`
- Current `Invoices.tsx` may have unresolved issues
