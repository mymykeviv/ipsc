// Enhanced filtering logic
const filteredStockHistory = stockHistory.filter(movement => {
  const matchesProduct = productFilter === 'all' || 
                        movement.product_name === productFilter
  const matchesFinancialYear = financialYearFilter === 'all' || 
                               movement.financial_year.toString() === financialYearFilter
  const matchesEntryType = entryTypeFilter === 'all' || 
                          (entryTypeFilter === 'incoming' && movement.incoming_stock > 0) ||
                          (entryTypeFilter === 'outgoing' && movement.outgoing_stock > 0)
