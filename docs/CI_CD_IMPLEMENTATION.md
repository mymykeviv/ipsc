# CI/CD Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive CI/CD implementation for the IPSC application, following **Change Management, Testing & Documentation Enforcement** rules.

## Impact Analysis

### Affected Services/APIs
- **Backend Services**: FastAPI application with enhanced validation
- **Frontend Services**: React application with improved error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automated migration support
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Multi-stage builds with platform support
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with environment support

### Breaking Changes
- **None**: All changes are backward compatible
- **Migration Path**: Not required - existing deployments continue to work

## Architecture Changes

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Continuous integration on every push/PR
- **Components**:
  - Backend tests with PostgreSQL service
  - Alembic migrations run to `head` before backend tests and before starting e2e backend server
  - Frontend tests with coverage
  - E2E tests with Playwright
  - Security scanning with Trivy
  - Build summary with status reporting

#### Deployment Pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated deployment to multiple environments
- **Environments**: dev, uat, prod
- **Features**:
  - Multi-platform Docker builds
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Automated rollback on failure
  - Release creation for production

### 3. Database Migration Strategy

#### Alembic Baseline and Auto-Migrations
- **Single Baseline Migration**: We consolidated historical migrations into a single baseline representing the current schema.
- **Auto-run on Startup**: Backend services run `alembic upgrade head` before the API starts in all Compose profiles and in generated artifacts.
- **CI Alignment**: CI executes `alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head` against the test DB before backend tests and e2e server startup.
- **Seeding Policy**: Seeding/sample data is dev-only and must not run in UAT/Prod.

#### Updated Files
- Compose: `deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`, `deployment/docker/docker-compose.uat.yml`, `deployment/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`, `deployment/standalone/docker-compose.yml`, root `docker-compose.yml`
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Artifacts: `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml`, `scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh`
- Local: `scripts/local-dev.sh`, `scripts/local-dev-clean.sh`

#### Health Monitoring (`.github/workflows/monitor.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Continuous health monitoring and alerting
- **Schedule**: Every 5 minutes
- **Features**:
  - Service health checks
  - Performance monitoring
  - Critical flow testing
  - Automated issue creation
  - Slack notifications (optional)

#### Pre-commit Quality Gates (`.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Code quality enforcement
- **Features**:
  - Python: Black, isort, Flake8, MyPy
  - Frontend: ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier
  - Security: Bandit, npm audit, Snyk
  - Test coverage enforcement
  - Build verification

### 2. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

#### E2E Test Suite (`frontend/tests/e2e/`)
- **Authentication Setup**: Auto-authentication for all tests

## Rollback Strategy

### 1. Automated Rollback
- **Deployment Failures**: Automatic rollback to previous version
- **Health Check Failures**: Service restoration procedures
- **Database Issues**: Migration rollback scripts

### 2. Manual Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Development Environment
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
git checkout HEAD~1
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# UAT Environment
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.uat.yml down
git checkout HEAD~1
docker-compose -f docker-compose.uat.yml up -d

# Production Environment
