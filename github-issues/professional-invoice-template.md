## üìã User Story

### Narrative
AS a business user, I want to use a professional invoice template with clean design and proper business layout, SO that my invoices look professional and include all necessary business information.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Paths:
1. Given I select the Professional template, WHEN I create an invoice, THEN I see a clean two-column layout with header, business details, and product table
2. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN I add company logo, THEN it appears in the top-right corner of the invoice
3. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN I fill invoice details, THEN all fields are properly aligned and formatted
4. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN I add products, THEN they appear in a structured table with proper columns
5. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN I view the charges summary, THEN it shows clear breakdown of taxes and totals

#### Sad Paths:
1. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN I don't provide required fields, THEN I see clear validation messages
2. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN the logo fails to load, THEN I see a placeholder with option to retry
3. Given I am using the Professional template, WHEN the layout breaks due to long content, THEN it gracefully handles overflow
