**Type:** Feature  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `invoice`, `settings`, `management`, `ui/ux`

## üìã User Story

### Narrative
AS a business user, I want to manage my invoice templates through the application settings, SO that I can easily switch between templates and manage my customizations.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Paths:
1. Given I am in application settings, WHEN I navigate to invoice section, THEN I see template management options
2. Given I have multiple templates, WHEN I select a template, THEN it becomes the default for new invoices
3. Given I have customizations, WHEN I save them, THEN they are applied to the selected template
4. Given I want to reset a template, WHEN I click reset, THEN the template returns to default settings
5. Given I have multiple customizations, WHEN I export them, THEN I can save them as a file

#### Sad Paths:
1. Given I am managing templates, WHEN the settings fail to save, THEN I receive error notification
2. Given I am importing customizations, WHEN the file is invalid, THEN I see validation errors
3. Given I am resetting a template, WHEN I have unsaved changes, THEN I receive confirmation prompt

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Usability:** Settings interface should be clear and organized
- **Security:** Template imports should be validated for security
- **Performance:** Settings should load and save quickly
- **Reliability:** Settings should persist across application restarts
- **Maintainability:** Settings should be easily extensible
