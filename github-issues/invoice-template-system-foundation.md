# Invoice Template System Foundation

## 🎯 Epic: Invoice Template System
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Feature  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `invoice`, `template-system`, `ui/ux`

## 📋 User Story

### Narrative
AS a business user, I want to have multiple invoice template options to choose from, SO that I can select the most appropriate design for my business needs and brand identity.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Paths:
1. Given I am in the application settings, WHEN I navigate to invoice settings, THEN I see a template selection section with multiple template options
2. Given I have multiple templates available, WHEN I select a different template, THEN the preview updates to show the new template design
3. Given I have selected a template, WHEN I create a new invoice, THEN the invoice uses the selected template by default
4. Given I am viewing an existing invoice, WHEN I change the template, THEN the invoice layout updates to reflect the new template design
5. Given I have customized a template, WHEN I save the invoice, THEN my customizations are preserved

#### Sad Paths:
1. Given I am in invoice settings, WHEN the template system fails to load, THEN I see an error message and fallback to default template
2. Given I am customizing a template, WHEN I make invalid changes, THEN I receive clear validation messages
3. Given I am switching templates, WHEN the data is incompatible, THEN I see a warning and option to proceed or cancel

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance:** Template switching should be < 2 seconds
- **Usability:** Template preview should be real-time and responsive
- **Maintainability:** Template system should be modular and extensible
- **Compatibility:** Must work with existing invoice data structure
- **Testability:** Each template should be independently testable

## 🛠️ Development Tasks

### Analysis and Tasks:
1. Create template configuration system with JSON schema
2. Build template registry and selection mechanism
3. Implement template preview component
4. Create template switching logic with data validation
5. Add template persistence in user settings
6. Implement fallback mechanism for template failures

### Technical Requirements:
- Template system should be modular and pluggable
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing invoices
- Use existing invoice data structure without breaking changes
- Implement proper error handling and validation

## 🧪 QA Tasks

### Testing Requirements:
1. Test template switching with various invoice data scenarios
2. Validate template preview accuracy across different screen sizes
3. Test template persistence and loading from settings
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing invoices
5. Test error handling for invalid template configurations

## 📝 Additional Information

### Constraints/Pre-requisites:
- Must maintain compatibility with existing invoice data structure
- No breaking changes to current invoice functionality
- Template system should be optional/opt-in
- Default template should remain as current invoice design

### Implementation Notes:
- Templates should be stored as JSON configurations
- Template system should support hot-swapping without data loss
- Consider using CSS-in-JS for dynamic styling
- Implement proper state management for template switching
