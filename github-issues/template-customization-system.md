## 📋 User Story

### Narrative
AS a business user, I want to customize the colors, fonts, and layout of my invoice templates, SO that I can match my brand identity and create unique invoice designs.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Paths:
1. Given I am in template settings, WHEN I select color customization, THEN I can choose from preset color schemes or create custom colors
2. Given I am customizing fonts, WHEN I select different font options, THEN the preview updates immediately to show the changes
3. Given I am adjusting layout, WHEN I modify spacing or alignment, THEN the changes are reflected in real-time preview
4. Given I have customized a template, WHEN I save the customization, THEN it's stored and applied to future invoices
5. Given I have multiple customizations, WHEN I switch between them, THEN each customization is preserved and applied correctly

#### Sad Paths:
1. Given I am customizing colors, WHEN I select invalid color values, THEN I receive validation errors
2. Given I am customizing fonts, WHEN I select unavailable fonts, THEN I see fallback options
3. Given I am saving customizations, WHEN the save fails, THEN I receive error notification with retry option
