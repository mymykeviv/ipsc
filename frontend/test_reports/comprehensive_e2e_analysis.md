## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Primary Issues Identified:**
1. **Missing UI Pages**: Most business pages don't exist yet
2. **Incomplete Navigation**: Side menu items don't link to actual pages
3. **Missing Forms**: CRUD operations not implemented
4. **Missing Data Display**: Tables and lists not implemented
5. **Missing Search/Filter**: Basic filtering functionality missing

### **Technical Debt:**
1. **Route Implementation**: Need to implement all business routes
2. **Component Development**: Need to create all business components
3. **Form Handling**: Need to implement all CRUD forms
4. **Data Integration**: Need to connect UI to backend APIs
5. **State Management**: Need proper state management for business data

## 📈 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate**: Fix the 3 working test failures (authentication + dashboard)
2. **Short-term**: Implement core business pages (products, customers, invoices)
3. **Medium-term**: Add financial management features
4. **Long-term**: Implement advanced reporting and settings

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for systematic development of the business management system, focusing on the most critical functionality first.
